# Kotlin-LLVM

This is a project for a Compiler Construction course. This implies that it shouldn't be taken as a serious project, but rather a exploration of the LLVM API.

It uses Flex for the lexer, Bison for the parser, and LLVM for code generation.

# How to build

Import into CLion, and build with the built-in configuration.
